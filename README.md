# Vue-Graphcool-Blog

Sample project that shows how to build a Blog App with VueJS, GraphQL, Apollo Client and Graphcool.

This example is based on the example ["Build a Blog with VueJS, GraphQL and Apollo Client"](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-blog-with-vue-graphql-and-apollo-client) that I modified to practice my skills. The original post uses GraphQL server built with AdonisJS and it also uses Bulma CSS. I have decided to replace "GraphQL server built with AdonisJS and Bulma CSS" with Graphcool and Vuetify. This project integrates Typescript in VueJS.

Technologies: Vue.js, Vuetify.js, Vuex, Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo Client and Graphcool.

``` bash
# Install dependencies.
npm install

# Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production with minification
npm run build
```
